# NcButton

General purpose button component. See props for different options.
[Use material design icons only for icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-material-design-icons) and remember to set their size to 20.

<ArgTypes />

## Usage

### Custom icon slot

To be used with `vue-material-design-icons` only. For icon classes use the `default-icon` slot.
It can be used with one or multiple actions.

<Canvas of={NcButtonStories.General} />

### Alignment

Sometimes it is required to change the icon alignment on the button, like for switching between pages as in following example:

<Canvas of={NcButtonStories.Alignment} />

### Pressed state

It is possible to make the button stateful by adding a pressed state, e.g. if you like to create a favorite button.
The button will have the required `aria` attribute for accessibility and visual style (`primary` when pressed, and the configured type otherwise).

Do not change `text` or `aria-label` of the pressed/unpressed button. See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-pressed

<Canvas of={NcButtonStories.Pressed} />

### Usage example: Sorting table columns

The standard way to implement sortable table column headers should be like this:

<Canvas of={NcButtonStories.SortingTable} />
