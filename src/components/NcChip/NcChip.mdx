## Usage

<Canvas of={NcChipStories.Basic} />

### Advanced usage

It is also possible to use custom components for the icon by using the `icon` slot.
In this example we are using the `NcAvatar` component to render the users avatar as the icon.

*Hint: If you use round icons like avatars you should set their size to `24px` (or use CSS variable `--chip-size`) to make them fully fill and align with the the chip*

Also it is possible to pass custom actions.
